# Image_Compression
The image can be compressed in a very straight forward way.
# Details
Here, an image is downloaded from the internet named as "lena"
The image is examined thoroughly and converted from the 8-bit to a 5-bit image.
The compression is done by approximating the values to the value falling under a particular range of approximation.
The architecture of the image is beautifully retained while the size of the image is substantially reduced.
# Result
A replica of the image with much reduced size.
